# Elastic Presentation

A React-based interactive presentation platform for Elastic field teams. It walks
prospects and customers through Elastic's platform, capabilities, and value with
polished animated scenes — all running locally in the browser with no backend.

**Quick facts** (for humans and LLMs):

- Single-page React 18 + Vite app, hash-routed (`/#/<scene-id>`), no server or database.
- A presentation is an ordered, enabled subset of **60 registered scenes** (`src/data/sceneRegistry.jsx`).
- **Deck presets** (`src/data/deckPresets.js`) are out-of-the-box flows: Platform Tour (default), New Prospect, Technical Deep-Dive, Whiteboard, Observability, Security, Search, All Scenes, No Scenes.
- Scenes can have internal animation steps ("**beats**" via the `useSceneMotion` hook, or lifted "**stages**" managed in `App.jsx`).
- A **presenter view** (`/#/presenter`) opens in a second tab and drives the audience tab over `BroadcastChannel`, with speaker notes and live previews.
- An **architecture whiteboard** scene (`/#/whiteboard`) provides a live drag-and-drop canvas for Elastic deployment diagrams.
- All user configuration persists to `localStorage`; content is customizable per scene through a Settings panel.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install        # install dependencies
npm run dev        # start the dev server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run build      # production build
npm run preview    # preview the production build
npm test           # run the Vitest unit tests
```

Routing is hash-based: `http://localhost:5173/#/<scene-id>` deep-links to any
scene, and `#/presenter` opens the presenter view.

## Core Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Scene** | A full-screen slide, registered in `src/data/sceneRegistry.jsx` with an `id`, `title`, `description`, `duration`, and optional `defaultDisabled` flag. |
| **Deck preset** | A named flow that enables exactly one set of scenes in a fixed order (everything else is disabled). Selected in Scene Settings. Any manual change switches the deck to *Custom*. |
| **Beat** | An internal animation step inside a scene, driven by the `useSceneMotion` hook. Beats are advanced by the global Next control and the presenter view. |
| **Stage** | Like a beat, but for scenes whose step state is lifted into `App.jsx` (`liftedStageControls`). Behaves the same from the presenter's perspective. |
| **Presenter bridge** | The mechanism (`src/presenter/presenterBridge.js`) that exposes a scene's beat/stage controls to the cross-tab sync layer. |
| **Scene metadata** | Per-scene user edits (title, duration, group, speaker notes, per-beat notes, content fields) stored in `localStorage` and editable in the Settings panel. |
| **Group** | Scenes sharing a `group` name appear as a single entry on the auto-generated Agenda slide. |

---

## Out-of-the-Box Flows (Deck Presets)

Presets live in `src/data/deckPresets.js` and are applied from the **Scenes** tab
of the Settings panel. Applying a preset enables exactly its scenes, in order;
every other scene is moved after them and disabled. Per-scene durations and
content edits are preserved when switching presets. The default preset is
**Platform Tour**.

| Preset | ID | Intent |
|---|---|---|
| **Platform Tour** *(default)* | `tour` | The self-running platform tour only. Used as the data-services demo opener. |
| **New Prospect** | `new-prospect` | Net-new pitch — market context first, no existing-footprint assumptions. 16 scenes ending in pricing, services, next steps, then the platform tour. |
| **Technical Deep-Dive** | `technical` | Architecture and platform internals for architects and platform teams — planes, node types, tiering, schema, cross-cluster, ES\|QL, deployment models, through a full reference deployment. |
| **Whiteboard** | `whiteboard-session` | A live working session — platform grounding and the reference architecture, then draw theirs on the live board. |
| **Observability** | `observability` | The Observability story — from efficient datastore to the autonomous AI SRE (Nightshift). Uses the 14 `obs-*` / `nightshift-*` scenes. |
| **Security** | `security` | Modern threat landscape → AI-driven SecOps → tool consolidation, governance, and commercials. |
| **Search** | `search` | The Search story — lexical foundations → vector scale → GPU → inference → context layer, then AI and ES\|QL. |
| **All Scenes** | `all-scenes` | Everything enabled in registration order — the full library. Newly added scenes are always included. |
| **No Scenes** | `no-scenes` | Blank slate — only Hero. Build a custom flow from scratch. |

---

## Scene Library

All 60 scenes, grouped as they appear in `src/data/sceneRegistry.jsx`. "Default"
indicates whether the scene ships enabled before any preset/customization is
applied (the Platform Tour preset governs the actual default flow).

## Presenter View

A dedicated control surface for presenting from a second screen. Open it with the
presenter icon in the nav bar (or navigate to `/#/presenter`) — it launches in its
own tab and drives the audience tab via `BroadcastChannel`, so both stay in sync
with zero server involvement.

- **Live previews** — a large, interactive preview of the current scene (buttons
  inside it are clickable and forward real clicks to the audience tab via DOM-path
  resolution) plus a preview of what's coming next.
- **Step-aware navigation** — "Next" advances the current scene's internal beats
  or stages first, then moves to the next scene. Explicit *Prev scene* /
  *Next scene* buttons, beat pills for jumping to a specific step, and a Replay
  button for scenes that support it.
- **Triggers** — in-scene animations (e.g. demo phases) exposed as one-click
  buttons in the presenter.
- **Speaker notes** — per-scene and per-beat notes, editable in place and synced
  to the same scene metadata used by Scene Settings.
- **Scene jump menu** — a searchable scene selector mirroring the nav bar's.

Implementation lives in `src/presenter/`:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `PresenterView.jsx` | The presenter UI: previews, controls, notes, footer navigation |
| `usePresenterSync.js` | Audience-side command handling and state broadcasting |
| `presenterChannel.js` | `BroadcastChannel` wrapper shared by both tabs |
| `presenterBridge.js` | Registers scene beat/stage controls for remote driving |
| `ScenePreview.jsx` | Scaled live rendering of scene components in the presenter |
| `domClick.js` | Serializes/resolves DOM paths so preview clicks replay in the audience tab |

---

## Architecture Whiteboard

The deck ships with a full interactive whiteboard scene (`/#/whiteboard`) for
sketching Elastic deployment architectures live — and for presenting them.

**Drawing.** Typed Elastic components with per-node specs, configurable pattern
blocks (cluster tiers, ingestion, user space), zones, styled connections
(per-edge color; solid/dashed/dotted/long-dash/dash-dot; thin/normal/thick),
sticky notes and text labels, clipboard copy/paste of whole subsystems,
arrow-key nudging, live **alignment guides** that snap a dragged node onto
another's row or column centre line, and a **Tidy** menu that either
straightens near-rows and near-columns in place or rebuilds the board into
left-to-right data-flow lanes. A corner **minimap** keeps the whole board in
view — click or drag it to move the camera. Nodes keep a fixed width per type but grow in
height to fit whatever they're showing — titles, sub-lines, and spec chips —
and template stacks and zones re-open around the taller boxes. Data Source
nodes carry an integration picked from the Elastic Agent catalog (384 GA
integrations, scraped from the package registry) plus a raw-ingest GB/day
figure.

**Boards.** Named boards with independent autosave and undo history, so you can
keep one per customer. Built-in architecture presets remain available in the
Architectures menu.

**Sizing.** *Build…* turns ingest per day, retention per tier, and agent/user
counts into a whole deployment: data tiers, a three-node master quorum (added
automatically once the data tiers reach six nodes), Logstash sized from
throughput, Kibana sized from concurrent users, optional dedicated ML nodes for
inference and anomaly detection (off by default, 16 GB floor and HA pair,
grown from ingest, and excluded from the master threshold since they hold no
shards), Elastic Agent in the ingestion zone, a separate monitoring cluster
hung off the cluster zone below the User Space, and the object store the frozen
tier snapshots into. Ingest is either
one hand-entered total or the **sum of the board's Data Source volumes** — in
which case the drawn architecture wires those very source nodes into its new
ingestion zone. Pick a provider: on Elastic Cloud (AWS, GCP, or Azure) the maths uses
the instance configurations ECH actually offers — documented disk:RAM and
vCPU/RAM ratios, node RAM snapped to each config's published size ladder, and
scale-out past the top rung — a hot-profile picker mirrors the deployment
templates (Storage Optimized, CPU Optimized, Vector Search Optimized, …), a
region picker narrows hardware to what each of the 58 ECH regions actually
offers, and the hardware table names the real config ids
(`aws.es.datahot.i8g`, `gcp.es.datawarm.n2.68x10x190`, …). Self-managed keeps
Elastic's tier-guidance ratios with best-practice raw EC2 picks (NVMe `i3en`
hot/frozen, dense `d3en` warm/cold, and so on). Every cell — instance, vCPU,
RAM, disk — is editable before drawing. It draws all of it as one wired
architecture using the same deterministic templates as the Patterns menu, with
every node fully specified. Cold and frozen mount searchable snapshots, so
replicas don't multiply their storage.

**Analysis.** A `Σ` panel rolls up nodes, vCPU, RAM, and per-tier storage, and
runs advisory best-practice checks (master quorum, frozen tier without object
storage, single data node, orphans). It totals the whole deployment into a
single quote line on whichever meter the deal bills against — self-managed
licenses 64 GB resource units derived from total memory (Logstash excluded,
since Elastic counts it for information only), while Cloud Hosted meters
consumption, so the panel takes the ECU figure from Elastic's pricing
calculator at the fixed $1.00 rate. Drawing a cluster picks the model from its
provider. Either way the line carries the list price and discount set in the
panel, in the tab-delimited shape the Pricing / ROM builder's paste importer
already parses (including a bold-label column so pasted rows look like the
builder's own), so a drawn architecture becomes a priced estimate without
retyping it. **Send to Pricing** does the same in one click without the
clipboard, landing the line as a new scenario in the ROM builder — with the
memory, node counts, and storage that the text paste can't carry — and never
overwriting a quote already in progress. A row left unpriced shows as a neutral
"awaiting price" to-do rather than a broken $0.

**Real data.** Paste `GET _cat/nodes?v`, `_nodes`, or `_cluster/stats` output
and the board draws the customer's actual topology into a new board, wired the
way the Elastic Cluster pattern wires one. Up to twelve nodes each instance is
its own box, titled with its real name and carrying the roles it reports;
beyond that the board groups by tier and role, with the instance names as a
subtitle. Every cluster node type has a **Roles** field, so the small-cluster
shape where one node is master + data + ingest is drawn as it actually is —
and a master-eligible data node counts toward quorum in the review panel.
Parsing is entirely local. **Compare** any two boards to get the migration delta: what the
target adds, drops, and resizes, and how the rollups move.

**Presenting.** *Present* hides the editing chrome; click a component to
spotlight it and its connections. Tag components with **build steps** to reveal
the architecture piece by piece — those steps are published through
`useSceneMotion`, so the [presenter view](#presenter-view) drives them like any
other multi-step scene, complete with beat pills and per-beat speaker notes.
**Saved views** are named camera positions per board: frame the ingest path
once, then number keys 1–9 fly there mid-conversation, and the present bar
steps through them while arrows stay with the reveal. A pen and arrow tool
annotate over the top, with strokes tied to the step they were drawn on.

**Sharing.** Export JSON, SVG, or PNG (2x/4x) with an optional title block and
category legend, copy the image straight to the clipboard, or copy a share link
that packs the whole board into a compressed URL. *✦ Write it up* drafts what
follows the session from the diagram, the rollups, and the review findings.
The **Follow-up package** goes further: one click renders the board, has the
model write a customer-ready recap (what was walked through, decided, and
still open, from the board facts and the chat transcript), and produces a
single self-contained HTML file — or the same package as markdown — with the
capacity numbers and review findings attached. Without AI credentials it still
builds from the deterministic parts.

**Customer details.** Each board can carry who it's for — account,
opportunity, stakeholders, install base, deal review, support health — typed
in or pasted from an `edm` CLI `--json` run, one paste per command,
accumulating. The AI reads it when designing and reviewing; the canvas,
Present mode, and the follow-up package's body never show it (the follow-up
header carries only the account and opportunity names).

**AI.** The *✦ AI* panel is a conversation about the architecture: it answers
questions from what's on the board, builds and edits it from natural language,
and calls the deterministic sizing engine when the numbers come up, so
"size this for 500 GB/day held for a year" returns the figures the calculator
would rather than invented ones. It sees its own review findings, can tag
sections with build steps for a staged reveal, and turns an imported cluster
into a review or a sized target state held against it. Ask for alternatives —
"build me two architectures, one hot-only and one fully tiered" — and it draws
each on its own board in a single turn, ready to flip between or compare from
the boards menu. Every change it proposes to the board on screen is staged for
**Apply** or **Discard** first, so nothing is redrawn out from under a room
that's looking at the diagram. *✦ Write it up* asks which artifact you
want first — an internal note, a customer email, the open questions, the risks,
or an SOW skeleton — then drafts it from the same board facts. Both run on **Amazon Bedrock** (Converse
API) with SigV4-signed requests sent straight from the browser. Bring an IAM key
pair with `bedrock:InvokeModel`; no proxy or backend involved.

**Grounded.** The model decides and narrates; deterministic code and retrieved
passages supply the facts. Six tools sit between the question and the answer —
`edit_whiteboard`, `size_deployment`, `search_knowledge`, `review_board`,
`lookup_integrations`, and `quote_deployment` — each one a wrapper over an
engine the app already trusts, so the chat and the panels can never quote
different numbers. Retrieval draws on a **curated Elastic corpus** versioned in
the repo (`src/data/knowledge/` — sizing rules, tier and ILM guidance,
reference architectures, the reasoning behind each review check, the two
metering models) and on the **customer's own documents** attached to the board
through *◫ Context*: paste or upload the RFP — as text, PDF, Word, Excel, or
even a screenshot — and it will design to it, then check the board back
against it. Binary documents are parsed by the configured Elastic deployment's
attachment processor (nothing indexed), by lazy-loaded browser parsers when
Elastic isn't there, or by Jina's vision model for images. While a turn runs the chat streams the
agent's steps live — which tool is in flight, on what query — and every reply
then carries the sources it used and a trail of what ran to produce it.

**Elastic, optionally.** Point it at a Kibana endpoint and an API key and
`search_knowledge` runs through **Agent Builder** against a `semantic_text`
index instead — browser-direct, no proxy, keys in `localStorage` beside the
Bedrock ones. If Kibana is unreachable the same question falls back to the repo
corpus and the reply says so, and customer documents never leave the browser
unless explicitly pushed. A **Check AI** pre-flight reports both providers and
separates a bad key from a bad agent id from a blocked CORS preflight — which it
answers with the exact settings block for this deployment's own origin. See the
[whiteboard README](src/components/whiteboard/README.md#connecting-elastic-optional)
for the one-time CORS setup.

See the [whiteboard README](src/components/whiteboard/README.md) for the full
feature tour, interaction cheat sheet, document schema, and code map.

## Customization (Settings Panel)

Open with the gear icon in the nav bar. Everything saves automatically to
`localStorage` and persists across sessions.

### Scenes tab

- **Deck presets** — one-click flows (see [above](#out-of-the-box-flows-deck-presets)).
  Any manual change flips the active preset to *Custom*.
- **Enable / disable** individual scenes; disabled scenes are hidden from the
  presentation and the agenda.
- **Reorder** scenes by dragging.
- **Set custom durations** shown on the Agenda slide.
- **Assign a group** to cluster scenes under a single agenda entry.

### Team tab

Configure the presenting team. Each member has name, role, email, phone,
photo, and an accent color. Members with the role **Account Executive**,
**Solutions Architect**, or **Customer Architect** are automatically surfaced in
the **Next Steps** contact panel.

### Customizations tab

Per-scene content editors (in `src/components/sceneEditors/`) expose the text,
stats, images, line items, and layout options of individual scenes — e.g. Hero
typing text, About stats, Pricing/ROM line items and discounts, Metrics
Dashboard cards, Visual Gallery images, Licensing tiers, Panel speakers, and
more. Select a scene from the dropdown to edit its fields; edits are stored as
scene metadata and survive preset switches.

---

## Navigation

- **Previous / Next** buttons move through the deck; Next advances a scene's
  internal beats/stages before moving to the next scene.
- **Dot indicators** along the bottom show position; hover for scene names.
- **Progress bar** at the very bottom fills as you advance.
- **Searchable scene selector** in the nav bar jumps to any enabled scene.
- Some scenes have **internal controls** (e.g. the Services Zero Downtime demo
  exposes a Reset button in the nav bar when active).
- Deep-link to any scene with `/#/<scene-id>`.

---

## Scene Motion System

Scenes with multi-step animations use one of two patterns, both of which the
global navigation and presenter view understand:

1. **`useSceneMotion` beats** (`src/hooks/useSceneMotion.js`) — a scene declares
   its number of beats and gets `beat`, `goTo`, `next`, `prev`, and `replay`.
   The hook registers with the presenter bridge automatically, so beats are
   remotely driveable and mirrored into presenter previews
   (`SceneMotionFollowContext`).
2. **Lifted stages** — a few scenes' step state lives in `App.jsx`
   (`liftedStageControls`) so the nav bar can render scene-specific controls.

Supporting hooks: `useAnimationTimeline` (anime.js timelines),
`useReducedMotion` (respects OS reduced-motion), `useSceneTransition`,
`useThemeStyles`.

---

## Theming

Dark mode (default) and light mode, toggled via the moon/sun icon in the nav bar.

- Dark mode uses the Elastic dark palette — deep blue backgrounds, teal/white accents.
- Light mode uses white surfaces with Elastic blue and ink tones.
- All scenes, the whiteboard, and the presenter view respond to the active theme.
- Persisted to `localStorage` as `presentation-theme`.

---

## Persistence

Everything is client-side in `localStorage`:

| Key | What it stores |
|---|---|
| `presentation-scene-config` | Active preset, enabled scenes, order, durations, per-scene metadata (content edits, speaker notes, per-beat notes) |
| `presentation-team-config` | Team title, subtitle, and all member records |
| `presentation-theme` | `'dark'` or `'light'` |
| `ew-*` | Whiteboard board index and named boards, custom architecture presets, AI config — see the [whiteboard README](src/components/whiteboard/README.md#persistence) |

A versioned migration (`ORDER_VERSION` in `SceneSettings.jsx`) re-applies the
canonical default flow when the shipped defaults change, while preserving your
durations and content edits. Use **Reset** in the Settings panel (or clear
`localStorage`) to return to defaults.

npm test
```

Vitest covers the parts where a regression would be silent:

| Suite | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `src/presenter/presenterSync.test.js` | Presenter command handling (next/prev, beats, scene actions) |
| `src/utils/whiteboardTemplates.test.js` | Pattern block instantiation and layout, props landing, build-step tagging, zone-level cross edges |
| `src/utils/nodeMetrics.test.js` | Content-driven node heights and chip formatting |
| `src/utils/whiteboardAnalysis.test.js` | Tidy lane layout, architecture validation rules, capacity math |
| `src/utils/whiteboardSizing.test.js` | Ingest → node counts, and the Pricing/ROM quote lines |
| `src/utils/pricing.test.js` | Paste delimiter detection, the bold-label column, priced-vs-unpriced rows, and the whiteboard → quote-line round trip |
| `src/utils/whiteboardDiff.test.js` | Matching components across boards and the reported delta |
| `src/utils/whiteboardImport.test.js` | Parsing `_cat/nodes` / `_nodes` / `_cluster/stats` into a board |
| `src/utils/whiteboardShare.test.js` | Share-link round-tripping and hash param handling |
| `src/utils/whiteboardAI.test.js` | All six tool schemas, component catalog, board snapshot with review findings, cluster guidance, the bounded tool loop, prompt caching, the summary genres, and the follow-up prompt |
| `src/utils/whiteboardFollowup.test.js` | The follow-up package: the self-contained HTML file and its markdown twin |
| `src/utils/whiteboardCustomer.test.js` | Recognising each `edm` command's rows, merging successive pastes, and the prompt text the AI reads |
| `src/utils/whiteboardKnowledge.test.js` | Tokenizing, chunking a document into passages, and the ranking that decides what gets cited |
| `src/data/knowledge/corpus.test.js` | That every curated passage carries a source, and that representative questions retrieve the right ones |
| `src/utils/whiteboardElastic.test.js` | Agent Builder `converse`, space-aware paths, the `semantic_text` index and bulk push, health checks, and each failure mode mapped to its own message |
| `src/utils/whiteboardPresenting.test.js` | Text wrapping, ink paths, build-step visibility |
| `src/data/deckPresets.test.js` | That every preset names registered scenes, enables exactly them, and keeps the full scene order |
| `src/components/whiteboard/ChatMarkdown.test.jsx` | The Markdown subset AI replies render in: blocks, inline marks, unpaired markers, and that markup can't be injected |
| `src/components/whiteboard/ElasticWhiteboard.smoke.test.jsx` | Mounts the whiteboard in jsdom: boards, presenting, ink, steps, sizing, comparison, the written summary, cluster import, board context, customer details, the follow-up package, alignment guides, saved views, the minimap, the Elastic connection and pre-flight, and the AI chat against mocked Bedrock and Kibana |
